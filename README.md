# plsql-indent
Custom "brute force" PLSQL indenter. 

Has no lex or parsing of any kind. Just manual syntax checking and indenting. Used mainly in spanish commented code and currently will fail if used with english commented code since it is also picking up the english comments and failing when finding keywords in the comments such as AND OR JOIN etc.

This is my initial share on Github in order to ger acquainted to working with it.

The code is to be worked with the latest .NET framework and written in C#
